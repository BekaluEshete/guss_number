# 🎯 **Number Guessing Game**  

A fun **command-line Python game** where you try to guess a **random number between 1 and 100** within a limited number of attempts. Choose between **easy mode (10 attempts)** and **hard mode (5 attempts)** and challenge yourself!  

---

## 🚀 **How It Works**
1. The computer selects a **random number** between **1 and 100**.  
2. The player chooses a **difficulty level**:  
   - **Easy Mode:** 10 attempts  
   - **Hard Mode:** 5 attempts  
3. The player **guesses the number**, receiving hints:  
   - **"Too low"** if the guess is lower than the number.  
   - **"Too high"** if the guess is higher than the number.  
4. The game continues until:  
   - The player **guesses correctly** 🎉  
   - The player **runs out of attempts** 😢
